            <h2>Agricultural Expansion:</h2>
            <p>Agricultural expansion is a major driver of deforestation, where forests are cleared to make way for crop cultivation, livestock grazing, and commercial agriculture. This includes large-scale plantations for crops like soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching.</p>

            <p> Agricultural expansion leads to the loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, and contributes to climate change. It often results in the displacement of indigenous communities and local populations that depend on forests for their livelihoods.</p>

        <div class="def-type">
            <h2>Logging and Timber Harvesting</h2>
            <p>Logging and timber harvesting involve the removal of trees for wood and paper products. Both legal and illegal logging contribute to deforestation, with clear-cutting and selective logging being common practices.</p>

            <p>Logging can lead to habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and soil degradation. It also contributes to climate change, as trees act as carbon sinks. Unsustainable logging practices can have long-lasting impacts on forest ecosystems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="def-type">
            <h2>Fire</h2>
            <p>Forest fires, whether natural or human-induced, can lead to widespread deforestation. Uncontrolled wildfires, often exacerbated by factors like climate change, can result in the destruction of vast forested areas.</p>
